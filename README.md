# 🎲 Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the **Guess the Number Game**! This is a simple yet addictive game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. Are you feeling lucky, or do you just have a great sense of numbers? Either way, let's dive in!

## 📜 How It Works

1. The game will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
2. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guess the number!
3. After each guess, the game will give you a hint:
   - **Too low?** The game will kindly ask you to aim higher.
   - **Too high?** The game will suggest you take it down a notch.
4. Keep guessing until you find the magical number and achieve eternal bragging rights! 🏆

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```
4. Start guessing the number when prompted. Don't worry, the game is super friendly, even if you're not a math whiz!

## 🤖 Code Breakdown

- **`random.randint(1, 100)`**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100. It's like rolling a digital dice!
- **`user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))`**: Takes your guess as input. Remember, the only wrong guess is the one not made (or, well, a typo).
- **Hinting System**: The game will nudge you in the right direction if you're off the mark. Think of it as a GPS for numbers!
- **`ValueError` Handling**: If you enter something that isn't a number, the game will gently remind you to stick to digits. No guessing "unicorn" here!

## 🚀 Ready to Play?

Download the code, fire up your terminal, and get guessing! May the odds be ever in your favor (and may your guesses be close to the mark)!

Happy guessing! 🎉
